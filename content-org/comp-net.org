* Computer Networks and the Internet
** What is the Internet?
*** 'Nuts and Bolts' view
- Network of networks (interconnected ISPs)
- Protocols everywhere e.g. HTTP, Skype
*** Services view
- Infrastructure that provides services to applications (email, social media, ecommerce)
- Provides programming interface (hooks)
*** What's a protocol
- Defines format, order of messages sent and received, actions taken on former

** Four Layer Model

* Network Layer
-
* Application Layer
- Most common communication model of applications: a reliable, bidirectional byte stream, which allows two programs on diff computers to exchange data.
  - Abstracts away the entire network to a simple read/write relationship


* Transport Layer
** TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
- Most applications want to communicate over a reliable, bi-directional byte-stream
*** Three Way Handshake
- Host A sends SYN (synchronise) message to Host B, indicating that A wants to establish a TCP connection with B
- B responds with a SYN + ACK (acknowledge), ACK indicate correct delivery (/reliable delivery/)
- A responds with an ACK
- Stream of Bytes: Emulated using TCP segments

*** Connection Teardown
- A sends FIN to B, B responds with (Data +) Ack, and B stops receiving data from A
- But B keeps sending data to A till B's FIN message
