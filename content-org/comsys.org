* Introduction

** Major Functional Blocks
[[/images/comm-sys-blocks.png]]
- Transducer: converts nonelectric message to electric signal

** Analog to Digital
- Signal distortion increases with distance
- Digital signals have enhanced immunity to noise and interferences
  - A finite alphabet makes the the receiver's decision more certain
- Analog systems: signals and noise within same BW can't be separated
- The sampling theorem states that if the highest frequency in the signal spectrum is B (in hertz), the signal can be reconstructed from its discrete samples, taken uniformly at a rate above 2B samples per second
- A quantizer partitions the signal range into L intervals. Each sample amplitude is approximated by the midpoint of the interval in which the sample value falls
** Channel Parameters
*** Bandwidth and Power
- Channel bandwidth B and the signal power \(P_s\) control the connectionâ€™s rate and quality
- The faster a signal changes, the higher its maximum frequency is, and the larger its bandwidth is
- Increasing \(P_s\)strengthens the signal pulse and suppresses the effect of channel noise and interference, to maintain a minimum SNR (signal-noise-ratio) over a longer distance
*** Capacity
\[C = B \log_2(1+\text{SNR})\]

* Amplitude Modulation (AM)
** Baseband versus Carrier
- *Baseband*. freq band of original message before modulation, measured close from zero. Much lower freq than modulated signal.
- Carrier has high frequency. Sinusoidal carrier can be formed from AM, FM or PM. (amplitude, freq, phase modulations)
** Double-Sideband (DSB) AM
