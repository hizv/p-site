* Introduction

** Major Functional Blocks
[[/images/comm-sys-blocks.png]]
- Transducer: converts nonelectric message to electric signal

** Analog to Digital
- Signal distortion increases with distance
- Digital signals have enhanced immunity to noise and interferences
  - A finite alphabet makes the the receiver's decision more certain
- Analog systems: signals and noise within same BW can't be separated
- The sampling theorem states that if the highest frequency in the signal spectrum is B (in hertz), the signal can be reconstructed from its discrete samples, taken uniformly at a rate above 2B samples per second
- A quantizer partitions the signal range into L intervals. Each sample amplitude is approximated by the midpoint of the interval in which the sample value falls
** Channel Parameters
*** Bandwidth and Power
- Channel bandwidth B and the signal power \(P_s\) control the connectionâ€™s rate and quality
- The faster a signal changes, the higher its maximum frequency is, and the larger its bandwidth is
- Increasing \(P_s\)strengthens the signal pulse and suppresses the effect of channel noise and interference, to maintain a minimum SNR (signal-noise-ratio) over a longer distance
*** Capacity
\[C = B \log_2(1+\text{SNR})\]
It is impossible to transmit at a rate higher than C without incurring a large number of errors.
* Amplitude Modulation (AM)

- Tone modulation: Modulation signal contains single frequency e.g. pure sinusoidal, so impulse arrows instead of continuous spectrum

** Baseband versus Carrier
- *Baseband*. freq band of original message before modulation, measured close from zero. Much lower freq than modulated signal.
- Carrier has high frequency. Sinusoidal carrier can be formed from AM, FM or PM. (amplitude, freq, phase modulations)
** Double-Sideband (DSB) Supressed Carrier AM
Carrier frequency should be greater than bandwidth of modulating signal
*** Synchronous/Coherent Demodulation
Demodulation can be done by repeating the modulation process, and the original message can be obtained via a LPF. But it requires a signal with same frequency as carrier, which is difficult. Signal attenuates/time delay so receiver complexity increases. This is fine for point to point but not broadcast.
** Conventional AM (DSB Full Carrier)
- The carrier is sent with the modulated signal. This can be done by a dc offset \(A_c\) before modulation.
  - \(|A_c + m(t)| \geq 0\) to avoid zero crossing to prevent phase reversal in freq domain, which distorts the envelope
- By following the envelope, we can recover the original signal
  - \(f_c >> f_m\) (max freq of message signal)
*** Envelope Detection
- Diode removes negative half
- RC circuit slowly discharges to follow the envelope
- \(2\pi B < \frac{1}{RC} < \omega_c\)
- \(RC \le \frac{1}{\omega_c}\frac{\sqrt{1-\mu^2}}{\mu}\)
*** Modulation Index

- \[\mu = \frac{A_m}{A_c}\]
  - \(\mu < 1\) to prevent overmodulation
  - \(A_c = \frac{V_{max} + V_{min}}{2}\)
  - \(A_m = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{2}\)
 \[\mu = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{V_{max} + V_{min}}\]
  - \(\mu = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{2V_C + V_{max} + V_{min}}\) for non zero offset
- For multi-tone modulation \(\mu_T = \sqrt{\mu_1^2+\cdots+\mu_n^2}\)
*** Power
- For singletone
   \[ P_{SB} = P_c \cdot \frac{\mu^2}{2}\]
  - \(P_{tot} = P_c (1 + \frac{\mu^2}{2})\)
- In general,
  \[P_T = \frac{\overline{m^2(t)}}{2} + \frac{A_c^2}{2}\]
*** Efficiency
Useful power resides in sidebands, whereas carrier power is only for convenience in mod-demod.
\[\eta = \frac{P_c}{P_{c}+P_{SB}} = \frac{\mu^2}{2+\mu^2}\]

** Single Sideband (SSB)
\[\phi_{\text{USB, LSB}}(t) = m(t)\cos\omega_ct \mp m_h(t) \sin\omega_ct\]
* Angle Modulation
[[/images/angle-modulation.png]]

- Constant amplitude hence \(P_{av} = \frac{A^2}{2}\)
- Bandwidth required more than AM and depends on modulation index unlike AM
- Better noise immunity than AM and can be increases with \(\Delta f\)
- Transmitters and receivers are more complex than AM
- All transmitted power is useful (no carrier and sidebands)

** Single Tone
- Carrier signal \(A_c\cos\omega_ct\)
- Freq deviation \(\Delta f = k_fA_m\)
- Modulation index  \(\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m}\)
 \[\phi_{FM}(t) = A_c\cos(\omega_ct + \beta \sin\omega_mt)\]

** NBFM (Narrowband)
If  \[\left|k_f \int_{-\infty}^t m(\alpha)d\alpha\right| \ll 1\] then \(k_f \int_{-\infty}^t m(\alpha)d\alpha \approx k_f\sin\omega_mt\)
- Bandwidth \(B_{FM} \approx 2f_m\) comparable to AM
- Requires \(\beta \le 0.3\) rad
** WBFM (Wideband)
\[\beta > 0.3\]
\(B_{FM}^{WB} \approx 2(\Delta f + B) = 2B(\beta+1)\) [Carson's rule]

** Phase Locked Loop (PLL)
- Phase detector: output proportional to phase difference between inputs
- VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator): monotonic frequency-vs-voltage characteristic (unstable)
- Loop filter: removes hi-freq components
- Stable hi-freq output using a reference lo-freq oscillator
** Superheterodyne Receiver
