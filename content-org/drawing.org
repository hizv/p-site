* Introduction
** Fundamentals
- MARK MAKING: Smooth, confident, controlled.
- OBSERVATION: Pay attention.
- *SPATIAL REASONING*: despite drawing on a flat page, the things you're producing exist in a real, three dimensional world
** Lines
- Draw from your shoulder (greater range of motion)
- Grip: tripod > overhand
- Marks should be continuous and unbroken, flow smoothly, and have consistent trajectory.
** Ellipses
- An ellipse can be interpreted in two ways:
  - in 2D, as an ellipse
  - in 3D, a circle facing towards/away from the viewer.
- /Degree/: angle of rotation of circle relative to viewer
- Degree shift: degree can actually be changed just by moving the circle around in space, without necessarily having to rotate it.

- The normal vector in 3D coincides with the minor axis in 2D, so if we need our circle oriented in a specific way, start out with a normal vector line and use it as a minor axis
** Boxes
- Vanishing Points
