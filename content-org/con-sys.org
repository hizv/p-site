* Mathematical Models of Systems
** Laplace Transform
| Time                | Frequency                 |
|---------------------+---------------------------|
| \(tf(t)\)           | \(-F'(s)\)                |
| \(t^nf(t)\)         | \((-1)^nF^{(n)}(s)\)      |
| \(f(t-a)u(t-a)\)    | \(e^{-as}F(s)\)           |
| \(f'(t)\)           | \(sF(s)-f(0^-)\)          |
| \(\frac{1}{t}f(t)\) | \(\int_s^{\infty}F(\sigma)d\sigma\)         |
| \(e^{at}f(t)\)      | \(F(s-a)\)                |
| \(u(t-a)\)          | \(e^{-as}/s\)             |
| \(\delta(t)\)            | 1                         |
| \(t^n\)             | \(\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\)    |
| \(e^{-at}\)         | \(\frac{1}{s+a}\)         |
| \(\cos(\omega_0t) u(t)\) | \(\frac{s}{s^2+\omega_0^2}\)   |
| \(\sin(\omega_0t) u(t)\) | \(\frac{\omega_0}{s^2+\omega_0^2}\) |
- The Laplace variable s can be considered as the differential operator, i.e.
\[s \equiv \frac{d}{dt}\]
\[\frac{1}{s} = \int_{0^-}^tdt\]
- Used to solve differential equations, which arise when describing system behaviour.
- Coefficient A of partial fraction decomposition of \(Y(s)\), corresponding to pole \(p_1\) is given by
\[A = \lim_{s\to p_1}(s-p_1)Y(s)\]
** Transfer Function
\[G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}\]
** Block Diagram

* Time Domain Analysis
- DC Gain, \(K = G(s=0)\)
** Response of a System
- Time Response is for aperiodic inputs:
  - Impulse
  - Step
  - Ramp
- Whereas frequency response is for periodic inputs (e.g. sinusoids)

|                      | Input R(s)        |
|----------------------+-------------------|
| Impulse              | 1                 |
| Step                 | \(\frac{1}{s}\)   |
| Ramp                 | \(\frac{1}{s^2}\) |
| Parabola (\(t^2/2\)) | \(\frac{1}{s^3}\) |

- To determine the steady state of response \(y(t)\), we may use the *final value theorem*:
 \[ y(t\to\infty) = \lim_{s\to0}sY(s)\]
** Feedback Control System
- A closed-loop system uses a measurement of the output signal and a comparison with the desired output to generate an error signal that is used by the controller to adjust the actuator.
- Error: \(E(s) = Y_{des}(s) - Y(s) = R(s) - Y(s)\)
- For a unity feedback system, \[E(s) = \frac{R(s)}{1+G(s)}\]
  - So, steady state error:
   \[e_{ss}=\lim_{s \to 0} \frac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)}\]
** First Order Systems
\[G(s) = \frac{K}{\tau s + 1}\]
- Settling time = \(4\tau\)
** Second Order Systems
\[G(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\xi\omega_ns+\omega_n^2}\]
*** Unit Step Response
\[s_{1,2} = -\xi\omega_n\pm j\omega_d\]
\(\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\)
\[\cos \theta = \xi, \ \sin\theta = \sqrt{1-\xi^2}  \]
- Peak time \(t_p = \pi/\omega_d\) at which
  - Peak overshoot: \(M_p = \exp(-\pi\xi/\sqrt{1-\xi^2})\cdot 100\%\)
- Rise time \[t_r = \frac{\pi-\theta}{\omega_d}\]
- Settling time
\[t_s = \begin{cases} \frac{3}{\xi\omega_n}  & 5\% \text{ tolerance} \\
\frac{4}{\xi\omega_n}  & 2\% \text{ tolerance}
\end{cases}
\]
** Stability
- A stable system is a dynamic system with a bounded response to a bounded input.
- Impulse response \(g(t)\) must be absolutely integrable.
- A necessary and sufficient condition for a feedback system to be stable is that all the poles of the system transfer function have negative real parts.
  - A system is stable if all the poles of the transfer function are in the left- hand s-plane
  - A system is not stable if not all the roots are in the left-hand plane.
- Marginally stable if simple roots on imaginary axis, with all other roots in left-hand plane.
*** Routh Criterion
[[/images/routh-criterion.png]]
- For a stable system, there should be no changes in sign in the first column.
  - The number of roots of the characteristic polynomial \(q(s)\) with positive real parts is equal to the number of sign changes in the first column of the array.

* Root Locus
[[/images/root-locus-steps.png]]

- Centroid and angles of asymptote have \((p-z)\) in the denominator
** Angle of Departure
\[\theta_d = 180^{\circ} - (\sum \theta_p - \sum \theta_z)\]
- \(\theta_p\) is the angle made by the pole/zero whose angle of departure is to be found w.r.t. other poles, i.e. angle made by a vector originating from other poles and ending at the pole in question with real axis.
- Angle of departure need not be calculated for poles/zeros on real axis as graph of root locus should be symmetric about real axis
* Controller Design
- The control effort \(U(s)\) is the output given by the compensator i.e. \(U(s) = G_c(s)E(s)\)
- In general, a PID controller has a transfer function \[G_c(s) = K_p + \frac{K_I}{s}+ K_Ds\]
  - When \(K_D = 0\), we have a proportional plus integral (PI) controller
  - When \(K_I = 0\), we have a proportional plus derivative (PD) controller
  - The PID controller can also be viewed as a cascade of the PI and the PD controllers.
    [[/images/effect-of-k-pid-variation.png]]
- We cannot change settling time using a proportional compensator alone
  - We can control \(\zeta\) or \(\omega_n\) but not both parameters

\[\cos\theta = \zeta \]
\[\alpha = \zeta\omega_n\]
[[/images/root-locus-omega.png]]
* Frequency Response
** Polar Plot
1. Put \(s = j \omega\)
2. Find magnitude and phase of \(G(j\omega)\)
3. Find points (mag, phase) at which \(\omega = 0\) and \(\omega = \infty\)
4. Separate Real and Imaginary parts by multiplying with conjugate
5. Points of intersection with Real axis and Imaginary axis
6. Plot these four points (intersections with axes and 0 and \(\infty\)) and connect them
** Gain Margin and Phase Crossover
\[\omega_{pc} \ @  \ \operatorname{Im}{G(j\omega)} = 0 \]
\[ GM = \frac{1}{|G(j\omega_{pc})|}\]

** Phase Margin and Gain Crossover
- Find \(\omega = \omega_{gc}\) for which
\[ |G(j\omega)| = 1\]

- Then \[PM = 180^{\circ} + \phi\] where \[\phi = \angle{G(j\omega_{gc})}\]


* Stability in Frequency Domain

** Contours
By convention, the area within a contour to the right of the traversal of the contour is considered to be the area enclosed by the contour. Therefore, we will assume clockwise traversal of a contour to be positive and the area enclosed within the contour to be on the right.
** Nyquist Plot

1. Polar Plot
2. Inverse Polar Plot
3. Nyquist Contour

** Nyquist Criterion
 - A transfer function is called a minimum phase transfer function if all its zeros lie in the left-hand s-plane. It is called a nonminimum phase transfer function if it has zeros in the right-hand s-plane.
 - A feedback system is stable if and only if the contour in the L(s)-plane does not encircle the \((-1, 0)\) point when the number of poles in the right hand plane is zero.
   - \(\omega_{pc} > \omega_{gc}\): stable system
   - \(\omega_{pc} < \omega_{gc}\): unstable system
   - \(\omega_{pc} = \omega_{gc}\): critically stable system
 - If the number of poles in the RHP is not zero, the number of counterclockwise encirclements
 - The \((-1, 0)\)  point on Nyquist plot is same as the  \(0 dB, -180^\circ\) point on Bode plot.
 - The gain margin is the increase in the system gain when phase = −180° that will result in a marginally stable system with intersection of the \(−1 + j0\) point on the Nyquist plot.
