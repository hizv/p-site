* Basics
** Clefs and Staffs
- Clefs assign notes to lines/spaces
  - Treble Clef (G Clef): Line around which it wraps around is G
  - Bass Clef (F Clef): Line between two dots is F
- Ledger lines extend staff
- Grand Staff: Treble and Bass Clef joined by Middle C
** Note and Rest Durations
- Adding a flag to a quarter note halves its time duration

** Time Signatures

** Dots and Ties
- A dot increases note duration by half

- Ties let the duration of a note travel across barriers like the measure line
- In the example, the 4th and 5th notes are combined = a half note
** Steps and Accidentals
- Keys next to each other are a half step away
- A tone (whole step) is two half steps
- Accidentals raise or lower pitch of notes
- Flat (b) lowers a note by a half step, sharp (#) raises.
- Black key between C and D: C# or Db -> enharmonic spelling, multiple names
- Double flats and double sharps alter a note by a whole step
