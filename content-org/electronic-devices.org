** Miller Indices
Three integers used to describe a plane.
*** How to find
1. Find intercepts of plane with crystal axes expressed in terms on basis vectors, e.g. 2 *a*, 4 *b*, 1 *c*
2. Take reciprocals of these numbers: \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4} 1\)
3. Reduce to integers and label as (/hkl/): =(2 1 4)=
*** Notations
1. If an intercept occurs on the negative branch of an axis, the minus sign is placed above the Miller index for convenience, such as \((h \overline{k} l)\).
2. Many planes in a lattice are equivalent; that is, a plane with given Miller indices can be shifted about in the lattice simply by choice of the position and orientation of the unit cell. Such equivalent planes are denoted using ={}= instead of =()=. For example, the six equivalent faces of a cubic lattice are collectively designated as ={100}=.
3. =[]= brackets are used for direction indices, e.g. the body diagonal of a cubic lattice can be designated [1 1 1]. =<>= is used for equivalent direction indices, e.g. all crystal axes =[100], [010], [001]= are denoted =<100>=.
*** Useful relations
1. The shortest distance d between two adjacent planes labeled (hkl) is given in terms of the lattice constant a as: \[ d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} \]
2. The angle u between two different Miller index directions is given by \(\cos \theta =\frac{h_{1} h_{2}+k_{1} k_{2}+l_{1} l_{2}}{(h_{1}^{2}+k_{1}^{2}+l_{1}^{2})^{1 / 2}(h_{2}^{2}+k_{2}^{2}+l_{2}^{2})^{1 / 2}}\)
3. /The direction/ [\(hkl\)] /is perpendicular to the plane/ (\(hkl\))
** Atomic Densities
- \(1 Å = 10^{-8} cm\)
1. \[\text{Volume density} =\frac{\text{# atoms in cell}}{V_{cell}} \]
2. \[\text{Areal density} =\frac{\text{# atoms in cell}}{SA_{cell}} \]

# TODO Examples ({110}, {111})
**  Diamond Lattice
- The diamond structure can be thought of as an fcc lattice with an extra atom placed at =a/4 + b/4 + c/4= from each of the fcc atoms. Thus, the original fcc has associated with it a second interpenetrating fcc displaced by =1/4 , 1/4 , 1/4=.
- Si, Ge form diamond like lattice
- Si unit cell has 8 edge (red) atoms, 6 (green) face atoms and three atoms at the centers of smaller cubes forming a tetrahedral bonding. A total of \(N = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 8 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 + 4 = 8 \) atoms per unit cell

* Energy Bands and Charge Carriers
# - The discrete energy levels of the isolated atom spread into bands of energies in a solid because in the solid the wavefunctions of electrons in neighboring atoms overlap, and an electron is not necessarily localized at a particular atom.
# - In a metal the outer electron of each alkali atom is contributed to the crystal as a whole, so that the solid is made up of ions with closed shells immersed in a sea of free electrons, and these electrons are free to move about the crystal under the influence of an electric field.
# - Fermion wavefunctions of a multi-electron system must be antisymmetric. When the spatial part is symmetric, the electron spins must be anti-parallel, and vice-versa (Pauli exclusion).
- The upper band (called the conduction band) contains 4N states, as does the lower (valence) band. Thus, apart from the low-lying and tightly bound “core” levels, the silicon crystal has two bands of available energy levels separated by an energy gap \(E_g\) wide, which contains no allowed energy levels for electrons to occupy. This gap is sometimes called a “forbidden band,” since in a perfect crystal it contains no electron energy states.
** Electrons and holes
- Electrons (=n=) in conduction band and holes (=p=) in valence band contribute to current.
- \(n \propto T\)
- Holes are generally heavier than electrons (Effective mass)
** Fermi-Dirac Statistics
 - Fundamental particles in nature have either integer spin and are called bosons (e.g. photons), or half-integer spin and are known as fermions (e.g. electrons).
 - Fermions follow Fermi-Dirac statistics, thus probability of finding electron at any energy state E  is \[f(E) = \frac{1}{1+\text{exp}(\frac{E-E_F}{kT})} \] where \(k = 8.62 e\text{-}5 \quad \text{eV/K} = 1.38 \) J/K and \(kT = (\frac{T}{300})25.9\) meV
   + Probability of finding a hole at energy \( E = 1 - f(E)\)
 - In a quantum mechanical system with many energy levels, the density of energy states per unit volume per unit energy is given by \[g(E)=\frac{4 \pi(2 m)^{3 / 2}}{h^{3}} \sqrt{E}\]
 - The density of states in the conduction band \(E > E_c\)is given by \[g_{c}(E)=\frac{4 \pi\left(2 m_{n}^{*}\right)^{3 / 2}}{h^{3}} \sqrt{E-E_{c}}\]
 - The density of states in the conduction band \(E < E_v\)is given by \[g_{v}(E)=\frac{4 \pi\left(2 m_{p}^{*}\right)^{3 / 2}}{h^{3}} \sqrt{E_{v}-E}\]
 - The number of occupied states between energies E1 and E2 is given by \[ N = \int_{E_1}^{E_2} g(E)f(E)dE \]
 *** (Boltzmann approximation)
 For energies much greater than the Fermi energy (\(E-E_F \geq 3\) kT), the distribution function can be approximated as \( f(E) = \text{exp}(-\frac{E-E_F}{kT})\), thus
 - \[ \boxed{n  = N_c \text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_c-E_F}{kT}\right)}\]\( (\int_{E_c}^{\infty} g_C(E)f(E)dE)\)
-   \[ \boxed{p = N_v\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_F-E_v}{kT}\right)}\] \((\int_{-\infty}^{E_v} g_v(E)f(E)dE) \)
** Semiconductor at thermal equilibrium
- No discontinuity or gradient can arise in the equilibrium Fermi level \(E_F\).
- Consider two materials in intimate contact such that electrons can move between the two.
- Rate of transfer of electrons from material 1 to 2 \(\propto\) (Filled states in 1) (Empty states in 2)
- \(R_{1 \rightarrow 2} \propto (N_1f_1(E)) (N_2[1-f_2(E)]) \)
- \(R_{2 \rightarrow 1} \propto (N_2f_2(E)) (N_1[1-f_1(E)]) \)
- At equilibrium, these two are equal. Rearranging terms, we get\(f_1(E) = f_2(E)\)
- Thus, \(\frac{dE}{dx} = 0\)
** Intrinsic semiconductors
- \(n = p = n_i\), thus\[ N_c \text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_c-E_F}{kT}\right) = N_v\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_F-E_v}{kT}\right)\] \[\therefore E_i := E_{F (intrinsic)} = \frac{E_c + E_v}{2} + \frac{kT}{2}\log \frac{N_v}{N_c} \] (/close to midgap in Si, Ge/)
  - Law of mass action: \(np = n_i^2 \text{(valid at equilibrium)}\)
  - \[ n_i^2 = N_cN_v \text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_c- E_v}{kT}\right)\] \[ n_i = \sqrt{N_cN_v}\text{ exp}\left(\frac{-E_g}{2kT}\right)\]
  - As \(T \uparrow, n_i \uparrow \uparrow\)
** Drift of Carriers in Fields
*** Drift Velocity and Mobility
 \(v_d = \)
\(\begin{cases}
\mu E & E < E_c \text{ [low field]}\\
v_{sat} & E \geq E_c \text{ [high field]}
\end{cases} \)
\(\text{where } \mu: \text{mobility } =  \frac{q\tau}{m^*}\)
- \[ \frac{1}{\mu_{eff}} = \sum_k \frac{1}{\mu_k}\]
*** Resistivity
 \[ \frac{V}{I} = R = \frac{\rho l}{A} \text{ where } \rho = \frac{1}{q(n\mu_n+p\mu_p)}\]

*** Hall Effect
\[V_H = \mathcal{E}_y\cdot w  = \frac{I_x\mathcal{B}_z}{qn_0}\cdot w = \mu_n\mathcal{E}_x\mathcal{B}_zw \]
** Extrinsic semiconductors
| Substitute one Si atom with B        | Substitute one Si atom with P            |
|--------------------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| B: p-type dopant                     | P, As: n-type dopants                    |
| # holes = # B atoms, \(p = N_A\)     | # electrons  = # P atoms,   \(n = N_D\)  |
| hole rich \(\rightarrow\) p-type semiconductor | electron rich \(\rightarrow\) n-type semiconductor |

- When \(N_D\) or \(N_A\) is of the order of \(n_i\), use \[ \boxed{p + N_D=n+N_A}\]
[[/images/band-diag.png]]
*** N-type
- \[ E_c - E_F = kT \log \frac{N_c}{n} = kT \log \frac{N_c}{n}\]
- \[ E_F - E_i = kT \log \frac{N_D}{n_i} \] Thus Fermi level is above intrinsic level (midgap) in a n-type
- \[\rho \approx \frac{1}{q\mu_nN_D }\]
*** P-type
- \[\rho = \frac{1}{q\mu_p(N_A)N_A }\]
- \[p = n_i\text{ exp}\left(\frac{E_i-E_F}{kT}\right) \]

* Excess Carriers in Semiconductors
Excess carriers are different from doping; in doping, the semiconductor stays in equilibrium, whereas creating excess carriers disturbs it.
** Optical Absorption
- A photon with energy \(h\nu > E_g\) can be absorbed in a semiconductor to generate an =EHP=. Less than that, and it passes through.
- \[ - \frac{dI}{dx} = \alpha I(x) \] \[\therefore I(x) = I_0e^{-\alpha(\lambda) x} \]

- \[ I = Aqn_0\mu_nE\]

  + \( 1 \mu m = 10^{-4} cm\)

  + \( v_{d(sat)} = 10^7 cm/s\)
- \[ t_{drift} = \frac{\Delta x}{v_d}\]

- \[J = q[n\mu_n+p\mu_p]\mathcal{E} = \sigma E \]
\(\sigma = \) \(\begin{cases}
\sigma_n & [n-type]\\
\sigma_p & [p-type]
\end{cases} \)
- \[\mathcal{E} = \frac{V}{l}\]
*** Formal Analysis
- As a system always tries to re-establish equilibrium, when light is impinged on a semiconductor, creating excess carriers i.e.\(np > n_i^2\), recombination rate R shoots up to go back home. [net recombination occurs: R > G]
- On the flip side, when carriers are extracted e.g. in a pn junction, thus making \(np < n_i^2\), G>R.
** Carrier Lifetime and Photoconductivity
- *Low level injection*: equal number of electrons and holes added, while it doesn't make a difference to majority carrier, it is significant for minority carriers, thus \[\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{\Delta p}{\tau_p}[\text{n-type}]\]
  \[\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = -\frac{\Delta n}{\tau_n} [\text{p-type}]\]
- Continuity Equation \[\boxed{\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = G - R - \frac{1}{q}\frac{\partial J_p}{\partial x}}\]
\[\\delta n(t) = \Delta n e^{-t/\tau_n} \\ | \\ \tau_n = (\alpha_rp_0)^{-1}\]
- In general, \(\tau_n = \frac{1}{\alpha_r(n_0+p_0)}\)
- Excess carrier concentration in terms of optical generation rate\[\delta n = \delta p = g_{op}\tau_n\]
- \[\boxed{n  = n_i \text{ exp}\left(\frac{F_n-E_i}{kT}\right)}\]
- \[\boxed{p  = n_i \text{ exp}\left(\frac{E_i-F_p}{kT}\right)}\]
- \[\frac{D}{\mu}=\frac{kT}{q}\]

** Diffusion of Carriers
\[J_n (\text{diff.}) = qD_n \frac{dn}{dx}\]
\[J_p (\text{diff.}) = -qD_p \frac{dp}{dx}\]

* Junctions
[[/images/pn-band-diag.png]]
- If \(x_n, x_p \rightarrow\) depletion width of n-side and p-side respectively, then \[x_p \cdot N_A = x_n\cdot N_D\]
  + Thus depletion width is higher on lightly doped side in pn junction
- \[\text{Depletion width } W = \frac{2\epsilon V_{bi}}{q}(\frac{1}{N_a}+\frac{1}{N_d})^{1/2}\]
- Built in potential\[V_{bi} = V_T \ln\left(\frac{N_AN_D}{n_i^2}\right)\]
- \[E_{max} = \frac{qN_A}{\epsilon_{Si}}x_p\]
** PN Junction Diode
- If we apply a voltage \(V_D\) across the PN junction, the built-in potential is reduced by this diode potential, so we can replace \(V_{bi}\) by \((V_{bi} - V_D)\) everywhere.
- Applying this voltage is like shining light on one side of semiconductor.
*** Relating carrier concentration on p-side and n-side
\[p_{n0} = p_{p0}e^{-(V_{bi} - V_D)/V_T} \] \[ n_{p0} = n_{n0}e^{-(V_{bi}-V_D)/V_T}\]
# (\(0 \rightarrow x=0 \text{ relative to depletion region}\))
*** Solving the Continuity Equation
- Since \(\Delta p \ll p_0\) on the p-side and \(\Delta n \ll n_0\) on the n-side, we only need to solve the continuity equation for \(\Delta n\) on p-side and \(\Delta p\) on n-side. [Low-level injection (\(V_D \ll V_{bi}\))]
- We can neglect recombination in depletion region, and generation is small relative to injection from one side to another. Also, in steady state, carrier concentration becomes unchanging, thus we are left with \(\frac{1}{q}\frac{\partial J_P}{\partial x} = 0\), i.e.
  + \(J_p\) and \(J_n\) are constant throughout depletion region and \(J = J_n + J_p\) is constant everywhere in the PN junction. The depletion region has no carriers, any entering will be swept across.
- \[\frac{\partial^2\Delta p}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\Delta p}{L_p^2}\] where \(L_p=\sqrt{D_p\tau_p}:\) diffusion length
\[\Delta p = A\exp{-\frac{x}{L_p}} + B\exp{\frac{x}{L_p}} \ \ \ [\text{B=0 unless short diode}] \]
- \[\Delta p(x) = p_{n0}(e^{V_D/V_T}-1)e^{-x/L_p}\]
- \[J_{n,sat} = \frac{qD_nn_{p0}}{L_n} = \frac{qn_i^2D_p}{L_pN_D}\] \[J_{p,sat} = \frac{qD_pp_{n0}}{L_p} = \frac{qn_i^2D_n}{L_nN_A}\]
  (Lightly doped side contributes to current)
\[J_{sat} = J_{n,sat} + J_{p,sat}\] \[\boxed{J(V) = J_{sat}(e^{V_D/V_T}-1)}\]
- \[\boxed{I_D = I_S(e^{V_A/V_T}-1)}\]
  + \(I \approx I_Se^{V_D/V_T}\)Under forward bias when \(V > 3V_T\)
  + \(I \approx -I_S\)Under reverse bias when \(|V| > 3V_T\)
- \(J_S \propto \exp(-E_g/T)\)
\[J \propto \exp\left(\frac{-(E_g-qV_A)}{kT}\right)\]
*** One-sided diode
- \(P^+N\) junction is formed when \(N_a \gg N_d \). The depletion region extends mostly towards the n-side.
*** Equilibrium
When a zero bias voltage is applied across the junction, the junction is in equilibrium. No ’net’ current flows across the junction. The drift and diffusion currents cancel each other
\[J_{\text{p,diff}} = J_{\text{p,drift}} \ \ \ J_{\text{n,diff}} = J_{\text{n,drift}}\]
*** Forward Bias
- Majorly diffusion current from p to n
*** Reverse Bias
- When a negative bias voltage is applied across the junction, the equilibrium is disturbed. Assuming that the p and n regions have very low resistivity, most of the applied voltage drops across the depletion region.
- Thus the voltage across the junction opposes the diffusion current, the diffusion current is almost non-existant under the rever applied bias. Only drift current dominates.
** Diffusion Capacitance and Resistance
- A differential change in the reverse bias leads to a
differenntial change in the charge. This can be seen as a
capacitive effect:
\[C_{diff} = \frac{dQ}{dV} \frac{qAe^{V_0/V_T}}{2V_T}(L_nn_{p0}+L_pp_{n0}) \ \ \ [V_0: \text{bias voltage}\]
- Normally depletion capacitance (\(C_j\)) is defined per unit
area (\(C_j = C/A\)) in pn junctions thus we have
\[C_j = \sqrt{\frac{q\epsilon}{2(\frac{1}{N_A} + \frac{1}{N_D})(V_{bi}-V_A)}} \text{(varicap)}\]
- \(C_j\) also depends on doping concentration profile. If \(N_D(x) = Gx^m\), \(C_{rb} \propto V_R^{-n}\), where \(n = \frac{1}{m+2}\)
- \[r_d = \frac{V_T}{I_D}\]

** Short Base Diode
- If length of n region \((\ell) \ll L_p\), Recombination rate = Zero as insufficient length available for holes to recombine
- Thus \(\frac{d^2\Delta p}{dx^2} = 0 \implies \Delta p = mx + c\)
- In the short side, replace recombination length by width, e.g. \(L_p\) by W.
- At the contact, no excess carriers are present as metal contact has infinite carriers that nullify them, i.e. full recombination.
** Non-idealities
- If \(V_A ~ 0.7 - 1 V\), the series resistance of p and n side kicks in and limits the current, i.e. current reaches saturation at high voltages. At small currents, contact resistance can be neglected.
- Recap: R > G if \(np > n_i^2\) else R < G.
*** Space Charge Generation-Recombination Current
- Traps reduce idealities, causing \(I_{FB} \downarrow, I_{RB} \uparrow\)
- Consider diode in =RB=. In ideal model, we only had \(J_0\). But now due to traps, \(np < n_i^2\) in the depletion region, causing net generation to realise equilibrium. Thus the actual RB current has an additional \(J_G\) term (\(\propto N_T, T\)), thus \(I_{RB}\uparrow\).
- In =FB=, more carriers, so net recombination, so \(J_{FB}' = J_0 - J_R\), thus current decreases.
** Breakdown
- At \(E_{crit}\), breakdown occurs. \[E_{crit} = \frac{2(V_{bi}+V_R)}{W}\]
*** Zener Breakdown
- Heavily doped diode
- Tunneling mechanism: Tunneling \(\propto \exp{(-W)}\) [depletion width matters]
- Less dependent on temperature
*** Avalanche Breakdown
- Lightly doped diode
- One electron enters depletion region, uses the electric field energy to generate an EHP, which in turn produce their own EHPs, causing lot of current.
- Multiplicative factor M = \((1+P)^N\) where \(N = \lfloor W/\lambda \rfloor\)
- Holes bubble up to the top, electrons roll down the hill of band bending.
** Switching in P-N junction
- If we apply a sinusoidal voltage across the diode, it takes time for the diode to switch from forward to reverse bias as recombination of excess carriers is not instantaneous
- To increase the switching speed, we must reduce recombination time \(\tau\), which can be done by increasing the number of traps. But that comes with a tradeoff: leakage current increases.
- Either the diode can be fast, or less leaky

** Metal-Semiconductor Contacts
- _Ohmic (ideal) contact_: R \(\rightarrow\) small
- _Rectifying (Schottky) contact_: allows current to flow only in one direction
- _Work function of metal_ (\(\phi_M = E_F\)): Minimum energy needed to be supplied to an electron for it to come out
  - Work function of semiconductor: \(\phi_S = \chi + (E_C - E_F)\), \(\chi\) is electron affinity, energy required to remove electron from conduction band
  - \(\phi_M > \phi_S \implies\) Rectifying contact, as depletion region created
  - \(\phi_M < \phi_S \implies\) Ohmic contact, as no depletion region, i.e. conduction same on both sides of MS contact
  - As doping concentration increases, depletion width decreases, so a Schottky diode can be converted to an Ohmic diode by doping very high
* Transistors
- Amplification
- "Transfer resistor"
** JFETS
- \(V_{DS}\) small: acts as resistor
  - \(V_{DS}\) larger: depletion width is not constant. Depending on where voltage difference is larger, larger depletion region
- Gradual Channel Approximation: depletion region varies linearly with length
*** Pinch-off voltage
\[V_P := V_{bi}-V_R \text{ when } W=a\]
- Internal pinch-off \[V_{P0} = V_{bi}\]
- \[V_P = \frac{qN_Da^2}{2\epsilon_S}\]
** MOSCAP
- p-type substrate: accumulation on the negative side of C-V curve
- High or low frequency, accumulation region remains same, change happens in inversion region
- \[C_{ox} = \frac{\epsilon_{ox}}{T_{ox}} \text{ where } T_{ox}: \text{dielectric thickness} \]
- \[C_{dep} = \frac{\epsilon_s}{x_{d(max)}} \text{ where } x_{d(max)} = \sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_S(2\phi_F)}{qN_A}} and \phi_F = V_T \ln{\frac{N_a}{n_i}} \]
