* Overview
- LTI System: building block
- Fourier Transform: Time to Frequency Domain (CT: continuous, DT: discrete)
- Sampling: Natural signals need to converted to digital
- Advanced Topics: Only covered if time remains
- If midsem/compre offline: then exam will be closed book, else open book: only handwritten notes.
- Quizzes could be online or offline: (15% weightage)
  - Surprise: n quizzes -> best (n-1) considered
  - Announced: n quizzes -> n considered
- Assignments: MATLAB
- Class recording only to those who attend, sometimes recording will not be provided
* Lec 1
- Signal: time-varying function that conveys information. Two types:
  - Analog: can continuously take on any value in a range
  - Digital: discretised. Fixed finite possible values.
- Sample times can be discrete or continuous.
* Lec 2
- \(x[n] \implies n \in \mathbb{Z}\) [discrete]
- \(x(n) \implies\) continuous signal
** Time Shrinkage Operation
- Consider the function \(x(\alpha t)\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\): shrinks to \(\frac{1}{\alpha}\) of original
  - If \(\alpha < 1\): expands to \(\alpha\) times original
- For discrete signal \(x[\alpha t]\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\):  remains same
  - \(\alpha < 1\): Output for which input is fractional become zero
** Advance-Delay
- \(x(t-t_0\): Delayed if \(t_0 > 0\) else advance
* Lec 3
- Arrow indicates sample value is at n=0

- Absolutely summable sequence: \[\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(n)| \le P < \infty\]
- Square summable sequence: \[\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(n)|^2 \le Q < \infty\]
  - Energy: \(\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(n)|^2\)

* Lec 4
** Power
\[P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{E}{T}\]

*** Discrete Time
\[ P = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{1}{2k+1}\sum_{-k}^k|x(n)|^2 \]
*** Continuous Time
\[ P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^T|x(t)|^2 dt \]
** Types of Signals
1. Energy Signal: Energy is finite, power is zero (\(P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{E}{T}\))
2. Power Signal: Power is finite, energy is infinite
3. Neither Energy Nor Power Signal: Both are infinite

** Necessary Conditions
*** Energy Signal
Must be
- Finite duration and Bounded
- Infinite duration, Bounded and Decaying

*** Power Signal
- Periodic signal are always power signals
Must be
- Bounded
- Infinite duration
- Not decaying

* Lec 5
** Impulse Signal
*** CT
- Infinite at x=0, and zero otherwise
- NENP signal
*** DT
- 1 at n=0, and zero otherwise
- Energy signal

* Lec 6
- A system is memoryless if the output \(y(n)\) depends on the value of input \(x(n)\)at n only, for all values of n.
* Lec 7
** Time-invariant System
Delay at the input should not change the ouput.
** Causal System
Output is independent of future values of input.
*** Noncausal System
Output depends on future inputs.
*** Anticausal System
Output depends purely on future values of input.
