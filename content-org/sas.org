* Signals and Systems
- Signal: time-varying function that conveys information. Two types:
  - Analog: can continuously take on any value in a range
  - Digital: discretised. Fixed finite possible values.
- Sample times can be discrete or continuous.
  - Arrow indicates sample value is at n=0

- Absolutely summable sequence: \[\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(n)| \le P < \infty\]
- Square summable sequence: \[\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(n)|^2 \le Q < \infty\]
** Energy
*** Discrete
  - \(E_{\infty} = \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2\)
*** Continuous
  - \[E_{\infty} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(t)|^2dt\]

** Power
\[P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{E}{T}\]
- Power of
*** Discrete Time
\[ P = \lim_{k  \to\infty} \frac{1}{2k+1}\sum_{-k}^k|x(n)|^2 \]
*** Continuous Time
\[ P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^T|x(t)|^2 dt \]
*** Types of Signals
1. Energy Signal: Energy is finite, power is zero (\(P = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{E}{T}\))
2. Power Signal: Power is finite, energy is infinite
3. Neither Energy Nor Power Signal: Both are infinite

*** Necessary Conditions
**** Energy Signal
Must be
- Finite duration and Bounded
- Infinite duration, Bounded and Decaying

**** Power Signal
- Periodic signals are always power signals
Must be
- Bounded
- Infinite duration
- Not decaying
** Transformations of Independent Variable
- \(x[n] \implies n \in \mathbb{Z}\) [discrete]
- \(x(n) \implies\) continuous signal
*** Time Shrinkage
- Consider the function \(x(\alpha t)\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\): shrinks to \(\frac{1}{\alpha}\) of original
  - If \(\alpha < 1\): expands to \(\alpha\) times original
- For discrete signal \(x[\alpha t]\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\): samples get skipped
  - \(\alpha < 1\): Output for which input is fractional become zero
*** Time Shift
- \(x(t-t_0)\): Delayed if \(t_0 > 0\) else advanced
*** Even and Odd Parts
- \[\mathcal{Ev}\{x(t)\} = \frac{x(t)+x(-t)}{2}\]
- \[\mathcal{Od}\{x(t)\} = \frac{x(t)-x(-t)}{2}\]
** Unit Impulse Signal
*** CT
- Infinite at x=0, and zero otherwise
- NENP signal
*** DT
- 1 at n=0, and zero otherwise
- Energy signal

** Basic System Properties
*** Memoryless System
- A system is memoryless if the output \(y(n)\) depends on the value of input \(x(n)\)at n only, for all values of n.
*** Invertible System
Distinct inputs lead to distinct outputs.
*** Time-invariant System
Delay at the input should produce an equal delay in output.
*** Causal System
Output is independent of future values of input.
**** Noncausal System
Output depends on future inputs.
**** Anticausal System
Output depends purely on future values of input.

*** Stable System
- A stable system is one in which small inputs lead to responses that do not diverge.
- Bounded inputs lead to bounded outputs.

* Linear Time-Invariant Systems
** DT LTI Systems
*** DT Signals as Impulse Sums

 - \[x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x[k]\delta[n-k]\]

 - Convolution sum
\[y[n] = x[n] * h[n] ::= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x[k]h[n-k]\]
   - \(h[n]\) is the output of the system when \(\delta[n]\) is the input

** Properties of LTI Systems
*** Commutativity
\[x[n] * h[n] = h[n] * x[n]\]
*** Distributivity
\[x * (h_1 + h_2) = x * h_1 + x * h_2\]
*** Associativity
\[x * (h_1 * h_2) = (x * h_1) * h_2\]
*** Memory
- If the output at some time should depend only on the input's value at that time, then \(h[n] = 0 \text{ if } n \ne 0\)
- \[h[n] = K \delta [n]\]
\(K = h[0]\)
 - Thus \(y[n] = Kx[n]\)
*** Invertibility
If the inverse system has impulse response \(h_1(t)\) then
\[h(t) * h_1(t) = \delta(t)\]
*** Causality
For a causal system, \[h(t) = 0  \text{ for } t < 0\]
*** Stability
The impulse response must be absolutely integrable for \(y(t)\) to be bounded, and the system to be stable, i.e.
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(\tau)|d\tau < \infty\]
** Unit Step Response
The unit step response \(s[n]\) of a system corresponds to the output when \(x[n] = u[n]\)
\[s[n] = u[n] * h[n]\]
- \[s[n] = \sum_{\infty}^n h[k]\]
  - \[h[n] = s[n] - s[n-1]\]
