* Overview
- LTI System: building block
- Fourier Transform: Time to Frequency Domain (CT: continuous, DT: discrete)
- Sampling: Natural signals need to converted to digital
- Advanced Topics: Only covered if time remains
- If midsem/compre offline: then exam will be closed book, else open book: only handwritten notes.
- Quizzes could be online or offline: (15% weightage)
  - Surprise: n quizzes -> best (n-1) considered
  - Announced: n quizzes -> n considered
- Assignments: MATLAB
- Class recording only to those who attend, sometimes recording will not be provided
* T1
- Signal: time-varying function that conveys information. Two types:
  - Analog: can continuously take on any value in a range
  - Digital: discretised. Fixed finite possible values.
- Sample times can be discrete or continuous.
* L1
- \(x[n] \implies n \in \mathbb{Z}\) [discrete]
- \(x(n) \implies\) continuous signal
** Time Shrinkage Operation
- Consider the function \(x(\alpha t)\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\): shrinks to \(\frac{1}{\alpha}\) of original
  - If \(\alpha < 1\): expands to \(\alpha\) times original
- For discrete signal \(x[\alpha t]\):
  - If \(\alpha > 1\):  remains same
  - \(\alpha < 1\): Output for which input is fractional become zero
** Advance-Delay
- \(x(t-t_0\): Delayed if \(t_0 > 0\) else advance
