I have written code in quiet hours and in restless ones. In industry I built pipelines that moved data across oceans of machines. In research I followed questions about memory, energy, and the hidden cost of intelligence. At Procter & Gamble I shaped systems that saved time and money. At Cornell and UIUC I asked how hardware breathes when pressed by algorithms.

I return, again and again, to the border where software and systems meet. There is the elegance of an algorithm, the stubbornness of a cache, the silence of a GPU waiting for data, and the long patience of models that learn only when given the chance to see more of the world.

This place is my notebook. Here I keep thoughts on engineering and on the machinery of intelligence. Some entries are small and sharp. Others wander and circle, searching for their form. I write for those who build, for those who study, and for those who wonder what lies between the two.
