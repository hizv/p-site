## Introduction {#introduction}


### Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

-   MARK MAKING: Smooth, confident, controlled.
-   OBSERVATION: Pay attention.
-   **SPATIAL REASONING**: despite drawing on a flat page, the things you're producing exist in a real, three dimensional world


### Lines {#lines}

-   Draw from your shoulder (greater range of motion)
-   Grip: tripod > overhand
-   Marks should be continuous and unbroken, flow smoothly, and have consistent trajectory.


### Ellipses {#ellipses}

-   An ellipse can be interpreted in two ways:
    -   in 2D, as an ellipse
    -   in 3D, a circle facing towards/away from the viewer.
-   _Degree_: angle of rotation of circle relative to viewer
-   Degree shift: degree can actually be changed just by moving the circle around in space, without necessarily having to rotate it.

-   The normal vector in 3D coincides with the minor axis in 2D, so if we need our circle oriented in a specific way, start out with a normal vector line and use it as a minor axis


### Boxes {#boxes}

-   Vanishing Points
