## Basics {#basics}


### Clefs and Staffs {#clefs-and-staffs}

-   Clefs assign notes to lines/spaces
    -   Treble Clef (G Clef): Line around which it wraps around is G
    -   Bass Clef (F Clef): Line between two dots is F
-   Ledger lines extend staff
-   Grand Staff: Treble and Bass Clef joined by Middle C


### Note and Rest Durations {#note-and-rest-durations}

-   Adding a flag to a quarter note halves its time duration

### Dots and Ties {#dots-and-ties}

-   A dot increases note duration by half

-   Ties let the duration of a note travel across barriers like the measure line
-   In the example, the 4th and 5th notes are combined = a half note


### Steps and Accidentals {#steps-and-accidentals}

-   Keys next to each other are a half step away
-   A tone (whole step) is two half steps
-   Accidentals raise or lower pitch of notes
-   Flat (b) lowers a note by a half step, sharp (#) raises.
-   Black key between C and D: C# or Db -&gt; enharmonic spelling, multiple names
-   Double flats and double sharps alter a note by a whole step
